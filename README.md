# Boilerplate e-commerce with Angular

## Technical spec

* Angular CLI 9.1.12

## Development server

First of all, if you didn't already, you must setup the [backend API](https://github.com/Rossb0b/e-com_boiler-_-back) developped on Node.JS.
Then, you must set your [Stripe API test key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) in the index.html file (line 22).

Finally, you are ready to run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Unit tests

Tests are not yet there but will be coming soon.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
